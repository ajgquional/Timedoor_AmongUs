# Among Us

![Among Us Sample Output](https://github.com/ajgquional/Timedoor_AmongUs/blob/a787c32caec2b21660fe23e135225a9dad7c24df/AmongUsSampleOutput.png)

## Description of the activity
This is the first Phaser activity of Intermediate 2 of the Intermediate JavaScript class of Timedoor Coding Academy. In this activity, students would familiarize themselves about the workflow of creating a Phaser game. With this, this "Among Us" activity is not really a full-fledged game; rather, students would just have to place the map background as well as the crewmates on their respective places within the map (making use of the preload and create methods). The codes for this activity are mostly copied from Timedoor's Intermediate JavaScript course book, but annotated and documented for clarity.

## About the repository
This repository only contains the sources codes (mostly copied from the book, but modified according to personal preference) as well as assets linked in the book (as a Google Drive link). Thus, this repository is mainly for reference. Should you wish to use these files, you may download them and copy them to the template folder but make sure first that a Phaser framework is installed in your local machine and necessary steps have been conducted (such as installation of node.js and Visual Studio Code). Afterwards, the public (which contains the assets) and src (which contains all the source codes) can be copied in the game folder. The "game" can be run by typing the command ```npm run start``` in the terminal within Visual Studio Code, then clicking on the local server link (for instance, localhost:8000) in the terminal. The game will then open in your default browser.
